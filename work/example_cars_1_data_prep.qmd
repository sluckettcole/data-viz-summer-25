## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load and prepare data
mtcars_clean <- mtcars |>
  mutate(
    car_name = rownames(mtcars),
    make = word(car_name, 1),  # First word is make
    model = str_remove(car_name, paste0(make, " ")),  # Rest is model
    efficiency = mpg / wt
  )

# Save processed data
write_csv(mtcars_clean, "data/mtcars_clean.csv")


```

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
