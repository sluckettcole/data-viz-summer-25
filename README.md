## Getting Started

To get started with this using this repository for this course:

1. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of this repository
2. This will create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account
3. Clone your forked repository using one of these methods:

   **Option 1: Using RStudio Project Wizard**
   1. Open RStudio
   2. Go to File → New Project
   3. Select "Version Control"
   4. Choose "Git"
   5. In the "Repository URL" field, paste your forked repository URL:
      ```
      https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/data-viz-summer-25.git
      ```
   6. Choose where you want to store the project on your computer
   7. Click "Create Project"
   8. RStudio will automatically open the project for you

   **Option 2: Using Command Line**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/data-viz-summer-25.git
   ```
   Then open the project in RStudio:
   1. Open RStudio
   2. Go to File → Open Project
   3. Navigate to where you cloned the repository
   4. Select the `data-viz-summer-25.Rproj` file

4. You can now work with the materials locally and push changes to your fork

Note: If you want to keep your fork up to date with the original repository, you can add it as a remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/data-viz-summer-25.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## Working with the Repository

### Where to Put Your Work
- Place all your assignments and work in the `work/` directory
- Since you have your own fork of the repository, you can work directly in the `work/` directory
- The `work/` directory is specifically designed for student contributions and won't conflict with course materials

### Avoiding Conflicts
- Course materials in `lectures/` and `examples/` will be updated by the instructors
- By keeping your work in the `work/` directory, you can safely pull updates from the original repository without conflicts
- If you need to experiment or try things out, use the `scratch/` directory (it's gitignored)
- If you modify files outside the `work/` directory, you may encounter merge conflicts when trying to pull updates from the original repository.
